# Exploratory Data Analysis of Individual Solver 1 Performance on the New York Times Crossword Puzzle
 
 ## Introduction

### Overview
This summary reports on exploratory data analysis (EDA) of 3+ years (late 2020- early 2024) of my own performance on the [New York Times (NYT) crossword puzzle] (https://www.nytimes.com/crosswords). Included are visual and statistical descriptions of trends in my solve times across this period, my performance relative to the 'Global Median Solver' (GMS; see next section), and the relationship between my performance and a number of variables. These variables included properties of the puzzle grids (e.g., number of answers, number of black squares), properties of clues and answers (e.g., prevalence of wordplay in clues, aggregate rarity of answers in a puzzle), environment (e.g., time of day a puzzle was completed), constructor identity, and my own past performance prior to a given solve. This EDA led to identification of a set of features correlated to my performance thus far that hold promise as useful inputs to a predictive model of my future performance.

This project would not have been possible without access to two key data sources. The first, [XWord Info: New York Times Crossword Answers and Insights](https://www.xwordinfo.com/), was my source for data on the puzzles themselves. This included a number of proprietary metrics pertaining to the grids, answers, clues and constructors. XWord Info has a contract with NYT for access to the raw data underlying these metrics, but I unfortunately do not. Therefore, I will not be able to share raw or processed data that I've acquired from their site (though [Jupyter notebooks](https://jupyter.org/) with all of my Python code for analysis and figure generation can be found [here](https://github.com/ursus-maritimus-714/NYT-XWord-EDA-Global-Median-Solver/tree/main/notebooks)). The second, [XWStats](xwstats.com), was my source for historical solve time data. This includes both my own data and data for the GMS.
